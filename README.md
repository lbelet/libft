## English

### Introduction

The Libft project is a fundamental project in the 42 school curriculum. It involves recreating a standard library in C, providing a solid base of useful functions for future projects. The goal is to deeply understand the functions of the standard C library and develop low-level programming skills.

### Features

Libft includes the following features:
- **String Manipulation Functions**: Implementations of functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strcat`, `strncat`, etc.
- **Memory Manipulation Functions**: Implementations of functions like `memset`, `memcpy`, `memccpy`, `memcmp`, `memmove`, `memchr`, etc.
- **Linked List Functions**: Creation and manipulation of simple linked lists.
- **Additional Functions**: Implementations of functions like `atoi`, `itoa`, `strdup`, etc.
